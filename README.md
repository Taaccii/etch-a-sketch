# Etch-a-Sketch Project from The Odin Project

## I created the etch a sketch project by trying my hand at it and tackling several challenges.

**I learned how to use JavaScript to create squares that are drawn every time the page is opened and every time the user makes a selection.**

The best part was getting all the listeners working so that both drag-and-draw and the single colored square function could work.

Then I wanted to implement right-click erase because it seemed like a quick and easy way to correct a mistake.

I feel like I followed the entire outline of the project assigned to me, including the extras of random colors and color opacity to create a blending effect.

**I had a blast making this project because now I'm really starting to understand the power of JavaScript... and we're just scratching the surface.
I can't wait to create something great!**
